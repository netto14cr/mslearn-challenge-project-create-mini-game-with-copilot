## Project Overview
In this project, you will create a console-based minigame where the player can play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer. The computer will randomly choose its move, and the game will determine the winner based on the classic rules:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

## How to Play
1. Run the game using Python.
2. Enter your choice: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
3. The computer will randomly choose its move.
4. The game will announce the result of the round: win, lose, or tie.
5. You will be prompted to play another round or end the game.
6. The final score will be displayed when you choose to stop playing.

## Features
- Simple and interactive console-based gameplay.
- Handles invalid inputs and prompts the user to try again.
- Keeps track of the number of rounds played and the scores of both the player and the computer.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
